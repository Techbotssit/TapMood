TapMood is a simple, interactive emoji display project built using NodeMCU (ESP8266) and an SH1106 SPI OLED display.
A touch sensor is used to cycle through different facial expressions (emojis), making the display react instantly to user interaction.

This project demonstrates bitmap rendering, scaling, animation, and touch input handling on a monochrome OLED screen.
